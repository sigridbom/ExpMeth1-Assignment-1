1;sfmsk;video_1;2;3;"The video was about two paper planes - a mother and a child. It seems they have a nice relationship where they dance together and the mother pays a lot of attention to the child. However, the mother also wants the child to leave the ""nest"" or the square around the paper planes. So the mother shows the child how to exit it and the child copies it nervously. However, outside the ""nest"" they ""celebrate"" and join tips and dance together again."
2;SD;video_1;3;3;I saw it as a metaphor for someone (the smaller triangle) wanting to gain independence (step out into the world) but not really having the courage to do it without a little nudge (from the bigger triangle).
3;S;video_1;2;3;To triangles move up and down and spins together (have a good time). The big triangle leaves the square (safe place), the small triangle shakes (nerveus). The big triangles helps the small triangle to get out of the square as well. The small triangle moves around outside (explore the unknown). They spin together in the end (have fun).
4;rss;video_1;2;2;In the video the two triangles were fighting, like brothers or sisters, over who could get the other one out of the square and in the end the little blue one gave up, but the big red one still wanted to fight, so it ran after it.
5;Rønn;video_1;2;2;The small triangle had a dance with the larger one. Then they had a disagreement, however they became friends again and left the containment box
6;sfmsk;video_2;2;2;The mother and child paper plane bounce on the walls outside the square. They're playing some game and enjoying themselves. Maybe the mother is teaching the child how to play. They keep bouncing back and forth kind of like that DVD screensaver logo, where it bounces from side to side and you want it to hit the corner but it never does. In the end they float out of the screen through the wall they were previously bouncing upon.
7;SD;video_2;1;2;Two triangles bouncing from wall to wall sometimes being a bit closer to each other and sometimes distancing from each other. I was half expecting them to end up together in the square in the middle but that did not happen.
8;S;video_2;1;1;The triangles move right and left. They bump into the walls (are constricted). At the end they move through the right side wall.
9;rss;video_2;1;2;The two triangles were bouncing of the wall from one to another over and over again
10;Rønn;video_2;1;1;The two triangles move parallel to each other horizontally. They moved at different speeds and had a square between them.
11;sfmsk;video_3;3;3;The mother paper plane is doing some kind of ritual/dance that the child paper plane observes and wants to copy. So the child follows the mother without her knowing it, however, the mother can maybe feel the child's presence and turns around and the child stops copying. Almost like the child was mocking the mother. The mother turns around and continues the dance ritual, and after getting suspicious one more time and afterwards continuing the ritual, she finally turns around to see the child copying/mocking her. She gets angry and the child storms out of the screen.
12;SD;video_3;3;2;The smaller one followed the bigger one but when the bigger one turned around, the smaller one acted as he just so happened to be there. Finally the bigger one confronted the smaller one and the smaller one ran away.
13;S;video_3;2;3;The triangles moved around, the big in front the small behind. When the small bump into the big, the big turns around suddenly (angry?). At the end the small run of through the left wall.
14;rss;video_3;3;3;The little triangle were trying to hide just behind the big triangle. every time the big triangle turned around it scolded the little triangle. at some point the big triangle got tired of it, and was very mad, which made the little triangle sad
15;Rønn;video_3;2;2;The small blue triangle followed the large red one. After avoiding numerous security checks, the small triangle eventually got caught
16;sfmsk;video_4;2;2;The mother and child paper plane bounces upon the walls again but this time not back and forth but more randomly, and exactly like the DVD logo I mentioned earlier. Only here there are two items/triangles/paper planes that bounce and sometimes they're pretty close to hitting each other and other times they bounce far away from each other. In the end they both float out of the screen through the walls they have been bouncing upon.
17;SD;video_4;3;2;The triangles were bouncing from wall to wall and it seemed sometimes as they would meet but the always passed each other untouched. Seemed as something that could be an analogy of two people's lives.
18;S;video_4;1;1;The triangles move around in the entire space.... Don't know
19;rss;video_4;2;2;The two triangles are looking for each other, but can't seem to find the other one, even though they goes right past each other at some points
20;Rønn;video_4;1;2;The two triangles moved sporadically around the field. Bouncing on the edges and almost colliding several times
21;sfmsk;video_5;3;3;"It looks like the mother and child paper plane have had an argument and that the mother wants the child to go back to his room/the ""nest"". So she forces him there but he wants to exit again, however, she won't let him. The child starts tickling the mother, which doesn't help the situation. She just gets more angry and the child returns to looking into the corner of the ""nest"". When the mother goes to the child, presumably to talk with him about their argument, maybe to resolve it, the child somehow escapes the ""nest"" and the screen and the mother is confused, looking for him."
22;SD;video_5;3;3;The bigger one  did not want the smaller one to get out of the room and after trying, the smaller one went to the corner and seemed to cry. The bigger one lost it's guard and came to see what's up and the smaller one had the chance to flee.
23;S;video_5;3;3;The big triangle move the small into the box. The small one tries to get out, but the big one blogs the way. The small triangle stroke the big one (giggles?) - the are tip to tip (happy?). The small one disappears. The big one is confused - searches for it.
24;rss;video_5;3;3;The big triangle tries to keep the little one inside the square, and it succeed until the little triangle starts to tickle the big one. then they fight for a while, but suddenly the little triangle starts to cry, and the big some comes to comfort it, but it was fake try and that way the little triangle escaped the square
25;Rønn;video_5;3;3;The small, blue triangle was confined to a cell by the large red one. Then it faked that it was crying and used this as a distraction to escape
26;sfmsk;video_6;3;2;"The mother and child paper planes bounce upon the walls once again, but this time the square/""nest"" is in the middle and they also bounce upon this. Sometimes they're close to hitting each other but they never do. It's quite similar to the previous bouncing video as it again looks like the DVD logo screensaver mentioned earlier."
27;SD;video_6;1;2;Another video where you'd expect them to bump into each other but every time the just barely pass without touching.
28;S;video_6;1;1;The triangles bump about in the space. ...
29;rss;video_6;2;2;Both of the triangles are looking for the entry to the square, but either of them finds it
30;Rønn;video_6;2;2;The two triangles danced sporadically around the cell in the middle, narrowly avoiding collision several times
